4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Create pull request** with clear description
6. **Ensure all tests pass** before merging

### Code Standards

- Write docstrings for all public methods
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
